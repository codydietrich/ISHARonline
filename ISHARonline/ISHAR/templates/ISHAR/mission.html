	ISHAR offers a practical, open-access resource for both researchers and the public to educate themselves about the status of current findings in Integrative Studies.  Multi-disciplinary subjects will be presented in an interconnected, holistic context while maintaining strict academic standards relating to their field of study, and pursue outreach and collaboration with scholarly organizations relating to integrative studies.  ISHAR will legally provide all available bodies of knowledge with an open-access ideology.
